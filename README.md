Instructions: 
Program #1: Personal Information
Write a program that displays the following information.

Your name
Your address with city, state and ZIP
Your telephone number
Your college major
Program #2: Average Age
Write a program that inputs the ages of five friends, calculates the average age (as a decimal) and displays the average age to the user. You can either do this via a loop (which we'll cover later in the class) or you can have 6 variables, one for each of the individual ages and one for the average age.

Program #3: Total Purchase
A customer in a store is purchasing five items.  Write a program that asks for each item, then displays the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total.  Assume the sales tax is 7 percent.

Program #4: Temp Conversion
Write a program that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures. 

The formula is as follows: F = (9/5)C + 32

The program should ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, then display the temperature converted to Fahrenheit.
